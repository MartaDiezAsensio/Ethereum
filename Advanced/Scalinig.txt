Scaling

As the number of people using Ethereum has grown, the blockchain hs reached certain capacity limitations.
THis has driven up the cost of the network, creating the need for "scaling solutions". 
Currently there are many solutions being researched, tested and implemented and each of them take different
approaches to achieve similar goals.


The main goal of scalability is to increase transaction speed (faster finality), and transaction throughput
(high transactionos per second), without sacrificing decentralization or security.
Keeping the barrier to entry low for node operators is critical in preventing progression towards cenrtalized
and insecure computing power. 

Conceptually we first categorize scaling as either on-chain scaling or off-chain scaling.

	ON-CHAIN SCALING 
		On-Chain scaling requires changes to thee Ethereum Protocol (layer 1 Mainnet). For a long time,
		sharding the blockchain was expected to scale Ethereum. This was going to involve splitting the blockchain
		into discrete pieces (shards) to be verified by subsetss of validators. However, scaling by layer-2 
		rollups hs taken over as the primary scaling technique. This is supported by the addition of a new cheaaper
		form of data attached to Ethereum blocks that is specially designed to make rollups cheap for users.

		- Sharding: Sharding is the process of ssplitting datbases. Subsets of validators would be responsible For
		individuals.
